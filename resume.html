    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3>Founder and CTO at <a href="last9.io">Last9.io</a></h3>
    <p>
    Last9 is a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Platform that removes the guesswork from improving the reliability of your distributed systems.<br/>
    With the growing adoption of microservices and a rise in application and infrastructure data, it has become harder than ever to manage the complexity of all the moving ephemeral pieces.<br/>
    Building a distributed system is hard. Observing it? Even more so. Improving its reliability? An endless pursuit of trial and error.<br/>
    All approaches to improving reliability are reactive and they cost a few unhappy customers each time. Current methods treat logs, metrics, and traces in silos. Last9 breaks these silos of information to build a rich knowledge graph and gives an end-to-end view of the entire system. It also provides an insights policy framework and anomaly detection techniques by highlighting issues way before they become incidents.<br/>
    </p>

    <h3>
      CTO and founding member at <a href="http://siminars.com">Siminars</a><br/>
    </h3>
    <p>
    I was a cofounder of this online training and education platform. Initially
    called Simversity and eventually, Siminars.com, this was where I was able to
    hone my skills in Software Engineering, Production systems management and
    shipping and maintaining large codebases.
    <br/>
    At Siminars, my responsibilities included architecture design, individual
    contributions, code reviews, pair programming, testing, system administration,
    devOps, database management and other aspects of shipping production ready Code.
    <br/>
    I had the opportunity to lead a tech team of varying talent and experience,
    which helped me appreciate the importance of building a team and playing by
    ones' strengths to achieve goals.
    <br/>
    It was here that I discovered my ability
    to raise the overall tech talent of my team, where we transitioned from using
    off-the-shelf tools to writing our own cutting edge tools and frameworks.
    We also put a handful of these tools and frameworks under OSS License.
    <br/>
    Brief Of the company:
    The Siminars platform enables presentation of rich media content in a
    structured sequential manner. Think of it as a series of rich blog posts that
    can be queued in a logical fashion and consumed as a simple online course.
    Added to it is a quora like community , social features, gamification and a
    very user friendly experience. This enables people who typically teach life
    transforming or self - development to break their concepts down into little
    consumable chunks and present them for high impact. The packaging enables
    them to sell "siminars" for a fee akin to an online course. Siminars can be
    thought of as "elearning lite".
