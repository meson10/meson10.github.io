<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>
  Software consultant at <a href="http://datascale.io">datascale.io</a><br/>
  <small>(June 2015 - present)</small>
</h3>
<p>
Automation, Infrastructure, Reliability and Scale.
</p>

<h3>
  Infrastructure and Backend consultant at <a href="http://safetychanger.com">safetychanger.com</a><br/>
  <small>(January 2015 - June 2015)</small>
</h3>
<p>
Helped in crafting an on-premise deployment path by porting to Configuration
management and Infrastructure provisioning using Hashicorp tools.<br/>
I was also responsible for introducing Golang to the tech stack and training
all software developers. Managed a small team of really young but smart
engineers and helped them improve the overall quality and stability of the
product code base.<br/>
I Also helped with noSQL Data modelling and schema management to move to a
multi-tenant system.<br/>
Among individual contributions, helped them circumvent AWS proprietary by
replacing it with OSS components to continue with the on-premise goal.
</p>

<h3>
  CTO and founding member at <a href="http://siminars.com">Siminars</a><br/>
  <small>(January 2010- January 2015)</small>
</h3>
<p>
I was a cofounder of this online training and education platform. Initially
called Simversity and eventually, Siminars.com, this was where I was able to
hone my skills in Software Engineering, Production systems management and
shipping and maintaining large codebases.
<br/>
At Siminars, my responsibilities included architecture design, individual
contributions, code reviews, pair programming, testing, system administration,
devOps, database management and other aspects of shipping production ready Code.
<br/>
I had the opportunity to lead a tech team of varying talent and experience,
which helped me appreciate the importance of building a team and playing by
ones' strengths to achieve goals.
<br/>
It was here that I discovered my ability
to raise the overall tech talent of my team, where we transitioned from using
off-the-shelf tools to writing our own cutting edge tools and frameworks.
We also put a handful of these tools and frameworks under OSS License.
<br/>
Brief Of the company:
The Siminars platform enables presentation of rich media content in a
structured sequential manner. Think of it as a series of rich blog posts that
can be queued in a logical fashion and consumed as a simple online course.
Added to it is a quora like community , social features, gamification and a
very user friendly experience. This enables people who typically teach life
transforming or self - development to break their concepts down into little
consumable chunks and present them for high impact. The packaging enables
them to sell "siminars" for a fee akin to an online course. Siminars can be
thought of as "elearning lite".
