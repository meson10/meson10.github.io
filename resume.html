<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>
  CTO at <a href="http://siminars.com">Siminars</a><br/>
  <small>(September 2009 - Present)</small>
</h3>
<p>
The Siminars platform enables presentation of rich media content in a
structured sequential manner. Think of it as a series of rich blog posts that
can be queued in a logical fashion and consumed as a simple online course.
Added to it is a quora like community , social features, gamification and a
very user friendly experience. This enables people who typically teach life
transforming or self - development to break their concepts down into little
consumable chunks and present them for high impact. The packaging enables
them to sell "siminars" for a fee akin to an online course. Siminars can be
thought of as "elearning lite".
